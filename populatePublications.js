        title: 'Incorporating Cannabis In Your Wellness Routine: Tips And Tricks',
        description: 'With the possibility of federal marijuana legalization on the horizon, you may only think this is a win only for the stoners. On the contrary, marijuana has several uses! You can use the flower for more than a fun night with friends. Whether you re smoking it, infusing it or anything in between, here are some tips for incorporating cannabis into your wellness routine. Jumpstarting Your Morning With Cannabis: When you think of starting your morning with cannabis, you might automatically think “wake and bake.” Even though smoking to start your day might seem ideal, it isn t always feasible. As an alternative, try starting your morning with CBD. Adding CBD to your morning tea or coffee can help you kick start your day with a more relaxed mindset. You could add a couple of drops of CBD tincture in your morning drink or take a CBD tablet in the morning with the rest of your supplements. Working Out With Cannabis: Cannabis can also help improve your workout. Adding your preferred tincture to your water or workout beverage could help enhance your performance. With cardio and weight lifting, for example, adding cannabis can help you lift more, run longer or faster as well as assisting with recovery. Some take CBD before workouts because it has been proven to have anti-inflammatory effects. Some prefer THC before a workout in the form of micro dosing or dabs to help with energy. Typically Sativa and Sativa-hybrid products are best for physical activity due to its energizing properties. But you may find a strain that works best for your body. Mindfulness With Cannabis: If you ask anyone who is keen to mindfulness practices, they would say that meditation is a great practice to achieve a better mindset. Many tend to overlook that mediation is a great way to work towards overall wellness. A large issue many face with the practice, however, are difficulties with relaxing, slowing down their thoughts, and focusing their minds. Luckily, this is where cannabis comes in to the picture. Using cannabis helps elements like your mood, behavior and thought development engage and create relaxing effects. Instead of coming home and facing a blunt after work, you can be more intentional with your decompression routine. Whether it be intentional breath work, a full out meditation session or just a few deep breaths, it is an opportunity to use cannabis to its fullest potential. Skincare With Cannabis: Maintaining healthy skin is a large component to overall wellbeing.  Cannabis and CBD products can assist with that. There are a variety of CBD and THC skin topicals to boost your skincare routine. The two are anti-inflammatories, meaning they are beneficial for reducing skin inflammation and impurities. You can use a topical moisturizer daily to keep your skin hydrated. You will definitely notice your skin feeling more nourished and healthy in a matter of weeks. Enhancing Bedtime Routines With Cannabis: Sleep is an important to overall wellbeing  and the refreshing of your mind and body. When it comes to maintaining healthy sleep pattern, some use cannabis to assist with their bedtime routine. You could use tinctures, pills, edibles, or even just smoking cannabis. If falling asleep high and the grogginess that comes along with that is not something you d like to opt for, you could just turn to CBD. You can always experiment with cannabis products to find what works for you to get a good night s sleep. Indica or indica-dominant products are typically the best for sleep due to its body heavy, euphoric, sleep inducing effects. Tips For Cannabis Use: When trying to incorporate cannabis with your wellness route, keep in mind that everybody is different as well as everyone s experience with the flower. Try to keep a journal when using cannabis for different reasons so you can track how certain strains and activities with those strains made you feel. In your journal you should note if its THC or CBD, the strain name, product used, the dosage, whether if it is Indica, Sativa or a hybrid and what you experienced while using it. This will help you figure out what is best for you as you experiment so you can find the best method for you! Remember to take your time and dont give up. Just like any other new thing you re trying, there are going to be trials and tribulations until you find a sweet spot.',

        title: 'How can we stop the opioid crisis? It involves medical cannabis - study',
        description: 'As marijuana becomes widely legalized for medical use, hopes have been raised that the wider availability of legal cannabis would help ease the opioid overdose epidemic. Now, science backs up this theory. A new study of thousands of patients, published in the peer-reviewed journal Substance Use and Misuse, found that people reported being in less pain and could function more positively both physically and socially after using medical marijuana. Opioids are effective painkillers but are also highly addictive, which has led to major public health concerns worldwide, with the United States at the center of the opioid crisis. According to the CDC, in the US from 1999 to 2019, nearly half a million people died from an overdose involving an opioid, including prescription and illicit ones. 90% of participants say cannabis was helpful in treatment. Researchers surveyed 2,183 participants who had a range of conditions, including anxiety disorders, chronic pain, depression, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Most were using medical cannabis daily. Answers to the 66-question questionnaire revealed that the vast majority (91%) both found medical cannabis to be very or extremely helpful in treating their medical condition and that it was very or extremely important to their quality of life (89%).Levels of pain diminished in 86% of participants. Some 84% said that health problems weren t impacting their normal social activities as much as before and more than half said physical activities, including housework and running, were t as difficult as they had been. More than two-thirds of participants (69%) experienced at least one side-effect, the most common being dry mouth, increased appetite and drowsiness. Most (61%) of the participants were taking opioids before being prescribed medical cannabis, with even more (70%) taking them for at least two years. Researchers said that 79% of those who had been taking opioids were able to stop or reduce using them. They added that before substituting opioid painkillers for medical cannabis becomes commonplace, more research is needed and that it is essential that the use of medical cannabis for pain relief is medically supervised. “A large number of people feel the need to take opioid pain medication,” said researcher Carolyn Pritchett, a neuroscientist and biological psychologist. “If there s the option to instead use medicine with less harmful side-effects, including a lower risk of overdose and death, then it should perhaps be considered. Like any other medicine with side effects, patients should be regularly monitored and assessed for adverse events, abuse disorder and other issues.” Medical marijuana: highly effective against cancer pain. An Israeli study published earlier this year backs up the claim that medical cannabis can be used as an opioid substitute for reducing pain. Medical marijuana appears to be highly effective in the battle against cancer pain, according to a Technion study published in May in Frontiers in Pain Research. According to Israel s Health Ministry, Israel has the highest rate of cannabis patients in relation to the population, despite it being classified as a "dangerous drug" and not being officially registered as a medication. The peer-reviewed study found that for most cancer patients, pain levels improved significantly and other symptoms also decreased with the use of medical cannabis.',

        title: 'CBD and epilepsy, study confirms whole-plant benefits',
        description: 'A whole-plant cannabis product is potentially more effective in the treatment of epilepsy than isolated forms of CBD, according to recent findings. Many experts have argued, anecdotally, that products derived from whole- plant cannabis – containing a range of different cannabinoids and terpenes – are more effective than those which contain isolated forms of CBD, particularly in complex conditions such as epilepsy. A team at the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney examined the effect of a nutraceutical product, extracted from the Cannabis Sativa L.plant on voltage - gated sodium channels in epilepsy. These sodium channels initiate action in the brain neurons, resulting in epileptic seizures. Inhibition of the sodium channels is thought to be part of the mechanism of action of many anticonvulsant medications. Recent studies have suggested that purified, or isolated, CBD also acts as an inhibitor of these channels therefore reducing seizures frequency.',

        title: 'CBN: A Cannabinoid For Sleep And More',
        description: 'CBN has been shown to have some overlapping effects with CBD, such as anti-inflammatory activity. But using CBN particularly for sleep appears frequently in literature. Scientists have confirmed the existence of over one hundred cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa, including cannabinol or CBN.What is CBN? While tetrahydrocannabinol(THC) is the best studied cannabinoid, interest in the endocannabinoid system has spurred research into lesser - known cannabinoids like cannabidiol(CBD), cannabigerol(CBG), cannabichromene(CBC), cannabidivarin(CBDV), and tetrahydrocannabivarin(THCV), and cannabinol(CBN).In this article, we ll dive into using CBN for sleep, explore if the cannabinoid CBN has other health benefits, and look at which cannabis products have CBN.Cannabinol explained: CBN was the first cannabinoid isolated in the 19th Century, and its chemical structure was defined in the 1930s.Early experimentation led to the observation that CBN could cause similar psychoactive effects to THC, but only at much higher doses. Perhaps the most unique characteristic of CBN is the process through which it is synthesized.CBN is formed through the oxidation of THC — a process that occurs naturally when cannabis is exposed to the oxygen in air, similarly to how a sliced apple will brown.Researchers report that it is difficult to make definitive conclusions about the effects and potential uses of CBN.Studies show that CBN potentiates the effects of THC in humans, but antagonizes the effects of THC in mice.Other contradictions concern how CBN affects dopamine and norepinephrine: some studies have found the CBN has minimal effects, while others have found that CBN may enhance or suppress the release of these neurotransmitters.CBN has been shown to have some overlapping effects with CBD, such as anti - convulsant activity and anti - inflammatory activity.One particular use for CBN appears frequently in the literature: using CBN for sleep.CBN for sleep: Sleeplessness, defined by one study as “less than seven hours of sleep at least two nights a week,” is “a chronic condition for up to 36 % of the U.S.population,” resulting in massive loss of productivity and “increasing the frequency, severity, and medical costs of personal injury.” A lack of sleep is also associated with a host of ailments, including obesity, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, heart attack, stroke, and diabetes.The same study notes that CBN has demonstrated relaxing and sedating effects without intoxication — meaning that CBN, when taken in an effective dose, doesn t give the same “high” as THC, but may still provide similar wellness benefits.Another study reviewed the effect of administering a combination of CBN and THC via extended - release capsule to 35 participants who were already medical cannabis users and had used cannabis as a sleep aid in the past.This study is affiliated with cannabis industry startup Curio Wellness, and states that the “validation study found that a repeat - action tablet[the specific type of extended release capsule used for this study] formulation of THC and CBN was associated with improved sleep quality.” Patients taking this formulation of THC and CBN reported improved sleep quality.In a 2022 review on cannabinoids and sleep, Maddison et al.report that “CBN can moderate the intoxicating and psychological effects of THC,” and note the importance of finding new alternatives to traditional sleep aids, which can come with issues related to “poor adherence, tolerance, or side effects.” The same review notes that many of the studies on cannabis and sleep “specifically recruited participants with a history of chronic or heavy recreational cannabis use, who appear to have poorer sleep than non - users” and that the “baseline or placebo data in these participants may be a reflection of sleep architecture associated with withdrawal.” CBN cannabinoid benefits: While many people use CBN for sleeping, CBN has various other potential health and wellness benefits.For example, a 2003 study explored the human skin permeabilities of Delta - 8 THC, CBD, and CBN with the goal of determining whether any of the three cannabinoids could be used for transdermal combination therapy, a type of hormone therapy that is sometimes combined with chemotherapy.The study found that the permeabilities of CBD and CBN were ten times higher than THC, suggesting that both cannabinoids could be adapted into transdermal products. In another study, Wong and Cairns(2019) found that CBN had nearly indiscernible effects on motor function and was actually more effective for pain relief when combined in a 1: 1 ratio with CBD than when used on its own.Although both CBD and CBN were found to be less effective for pain relief than THC, the lack of intoxicating effects from either makes them worth further research.CBN also might serve as a non - intoxicating alternative to THC for users looking to stimulate appetite.One study conducted on the effects of CBN and CBD on rat feeding patterns found that administration of CBN resulted in reductions of time between eating bouts and “significant increases in the food consumed during the first hour and meal,” indicating that CBN stimulates appetite.Additional potential medical and wellness benefits of CBN include its “anticonvulsant, anti - inflammatory, antibacterial(specifically against MRSA), anti - proliferative, and anti - tumor effects.',

        title: 'Medical cannabis safe and effective in older adults, study',
        description: 'A new study has found medical cannabis to be a safe and effective treatment for chronic pain in older adults. In a paper published last month, researchers in Canada assessed the safety and efficacy of medical cannabis products in a group of patients aged 65 or older. All of the participants were authorised to consume cannabis medicinally through Canadian health clinics. Consistent with other studies, the findings suggest that cannabis was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with meaningful reductions in pain, when used over a three-month period. No serious adverse events were reported, and ‘non-serious’ adverse events were experienced in less than 12% of patients, the authors acknowledged. Cannabis, and particularly CBD, is becoming more popular among the older adult population, with use increasing ten-fold in Canada between 2012 and 2019, according to the paper. Previous surveys have suggested that this age group generally use cannabis for pain and sleep disorders, with positive results. Findings from the US National Cannabis Survey published last year show that 26% of cannabis consumers (nearly 17 million Americans) are aged 50 or older. Most patients in the study reported no prior experience with cannabis. Oil was the preferred delivery method among patients, with the most commonly authorised product being CBD-dominant, followed by a balanced CBD to THC ratio. Only 4% of the sample group were consuming a THC-dominant oil. The study’s authors concluded: “Our findings inform the under-explored area of medical cannabis use in this population and suggest that medical cannabis is associated with therapeutic effects on pain in older adults with an acceptable safety profile, but that there is significant variability in product profile and dose consumed.” They added: “It will be important to continue to examine the long-term safety and effectiveness of medical cannabis in older adults through RWE studies and to examine cause and effect relations through RCTs across a variety of health conditions.”',

Seizures can present themselves as twitching, trembling, drooling, confusion, loss of balance or consciousness, convulsions, involuntary urination or defecation, and even a complete loss of consciousness. While some seizures might be no big deal, others can last for minutes and lead to a loss of coordination or other problems for hours after the seizure is over. Seizures should be taken seriously, as they may indicate serious health problems such as epilepsy, brain tumors, liver disease, organ failure, or rabies. Why do dogs seize? Ten million dogs in the US alone suffer from seizures, with various causes resulting in different severities. Dogs may seize because of poisoning from food, diseases like distemper, old age, liver disease, kidney failure, injury to the brain or spine, brain tumors, a stroke, or a hereditary condition such as epilepsy. How will I know if my dog is having a seizure? If your dog is having a seizure you might notice some of the following: rapid body movements, head or eye twitching, foaming at the mouth, whimpering, whining or growling, loss of consciousness, or responsiveness to stimuli such as pain. Seizures can last anywhere from a few seconds up to several minutes and may cause your dog to urinate or defecate involuntarily. What should I do if my dog has a seizure? If you notice that your dog is having a seizure, try to determine how long it lasts and take note of the time and any changes to your dogs behavior after the seizure is over.If it seems like your dog does not regain consciousness within a few minutes, take them to the nearest emergency veterinarian as soon as possible.If you can do so safely, try to keep other animals and people away from your seizing dog and stay with them until the seizure ends.Do not place any objects or your hands in their mouth, as they may snap at you by accident.If your dog appears to be choking, perform the Heimlich maneuver.You should keep a close eye on your dog for the next 24 hours after a seizure occurs, as dogs are more likely to have another seizure within a day or two of the first one.While many dogs will recover from seizures on their own, some may have severe consequences and need medical attention or immediate treatment.Dogs with epilepsy often experience more seizures than dogs who suffer from other conditions, so it is important to watch your dog for any changes in behavior that could indicate a seizure.How can CBD help my dogs seizures? CBD may be able to help with your dogs seizures in several ways.The first is by reducing the number of seizures your dog experiences if they have epilepsy or another condition that leads to repeated seizures.Secondly, CBD may be able to reduce the severity or length of these seizures.The reason for this is that CBD may be able to regulate harmful electrical activity in a dogs brain that leads to seizures and reduce the amount of stress or injury caused by uncontrolled neurochemical exchanges. Finally, CBD may have a positive effect on your dogs mood during and after a seizure by regulating neurotransmitter levels in the brain.Not all CBD is created equally, so make sure you purchase a high - quality CBD extract to ensure its safety and effectiveness.And, of course, talk to your veterinarian to make sure CBD is right for your dog.Will CBD oil treat seizures in dogs ? As with any sort of treatment, CBD oil will help some dogs more than others.However, it is important to note that CBD oil is not a cure for seizures, but rather a supplement that can be used in conjunction with other medications and treatments.Many pet owners report good results using CBD oils alongside anticonvulsant medications.What are some other medications a dog with seizures may have to take ? Some other medications a dog with seizures may have to take include: Phenobarbital: A barbiturate that is used to control seizures in dogs.Potassium bromide: Also used to control seizures, potassium bromide can be used in combination with phenobarbital or on its own.Zonisamide: Another anticonvulsant that is sometimes prescribed to dogs with seizures.Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines such as diazepam and midazolam can be used to relieve anxiety during a seizure.Antidepressants: Amitriptyline is one type of antidepressant that may be prescribed to dogs who suffer from seizures because it has the ability to lessen the frequency and severity of seizures in some cases.What are the different types of CBD Oil for Dogs ? CBD oils are generally either tinctures, which are drops placed under the tongue, or topical ointments that can be applied directly to areas of pain.Most CBD oil for dogs comes in a tincture form that can be added to food or given directly to your pet by mouth.How long does CBD Oil take to work for seizures in dogs ? CBD oil can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to be effective.It is best to give the CBD oil for at least two weeks before giving up on it if you are not seeing results.Like any supplement, your dog may respond better or worse than other dogs, so adjusting dosage accordingly may help speed up the process of seeing whether CBD oil is effective.How Should you dose CBD Oil for Dogs ? Since every dog is different, start with a low dose of CBD oil and then slowly increase until your pet responds positively.The standard dosage for dogs is between 10 mg - 30 mg per pound of body weight, given twice daily.However, this may be adjusted depending on the severity of your dogs seizures.',
